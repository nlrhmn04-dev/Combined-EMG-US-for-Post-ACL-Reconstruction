# Combined-EMG-US-for-Post-ACL-Reconstruction
ACL tears results in significant atrophy in the injured leg; this project aims to assist in the rehabilitation of athletes. By combining ultrasound imaging with electromyography (EMG), clinicians can use combined metric, in muscle thickness and activation, that can be used to assess rehabilitation.
## Repository Structure
1. **Architecture** – system block diagrams and design overview  
2. **Schematics** – EMG front-end and electrode interface  
3. **PCB** – layout, stackup, and grounding  
4. **Simulations** – filter and frequency-response analysis  
5. **Firmware** – ADS1299 configuration and data acquisition  
6. **Test Data** – bench validation results
